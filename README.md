**Task Description: Create a User Directory with Search and Filter Functionality**
**Objective**
Develop a web page using Next.js/React that fetches user data from a public API and displays it in a user-friendly directory.

The directory should allow users to search by name and filter by nationality.

**Requirements**
1. Fetch User Data

Use the Random User API (https://randomuser.me/api/?results=50) to fetch data.
- Store the fetched data in the component's state.
- Define User Type
Show user details including:
- Profile image
- First name
- Last name
- Email
- Nationality


**2. Search Functionality**

- Add an input field to search users by their first or last name.
The search should be case-insensitive and update the displayed list in real-time.
- Filter by Nationality
Add a dropdown to filter users by nationality.
Ensure that the dropdown does not contain duplicate nationalities.

Default option should be "All" to display users of all nationalities.
